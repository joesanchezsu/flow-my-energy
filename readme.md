# ✨ Flow My Energy, the Source Said

A generative WebGL artwork visualizing a journey from disconnection to unity —  
particles begin in turbulent chaos and gradually align into flowing harmony, revealing a toroidal field that echoes spiritual, metaphysical, and cosmic principles.

The title is a playful nod to Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said,
a novel about losing identity — this artwork reimagines the title as a cosmic whisper from the Source — reminding us that what feels fragmented is part of a deeper, universal flow.

## 🔮 Concept

- Particles represent individual energies, scattered and chaotic at first.
- Over time, each aligns into harmonic structures, forming energetic “lines” in a toroidal flow field.
- As alignment increases, internal turbulence fades, revealing connection, rhythm, and presence.
- Messages emerge as the system reaches coherence — like thoughts during meditation.

This piece symbolizes the energetic journey:  
from ego to source, from separation to unity, from noise to resonance.
